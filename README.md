This is your starting point for learning the fundamentals of creating websites. Here's a glimpse of what you'll discover:

Building Blocks:

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): The foundation of web pages, providing structure and content.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): Defines the look and feel of your website, like colors, fonts, and layout.
JavaScript (Optional): Adds interactivity to your website, making it more dynamic and engaging.
